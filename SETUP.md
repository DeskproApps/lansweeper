2. Copy the __"Ð¡allback URL"__ on the "Settings" tab in Deskpro and paste it into the __"Allowed callback URL"__
3. Choose __"Other"__ in the Integration dropdown
4. In the __"Custom Integration Name"__ field, you can enter "Deskpro App" the same as in the "Application name" field.
5. The __"Developed by"__ and __"Description"__ fields can be left blank. However, feel free to fill them in as you see fit.

After filling in the fields, click __"Add Application"__. Then save the generated credentials and store them in a secure place.

Ok, head back to Deskpro and enter your __Client ID__ and __Client secret__ into the app settings form which you got from the generated credentials in Lansweeper.
